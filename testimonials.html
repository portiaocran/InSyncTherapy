                    Priscilla has drastically helped me cope with big emotions surrounding my job and relationships over the 
                past two years as my therapist. I started seeing her in 2022, during a very stressful and toxic time at work. 
                She immediately understood the challenges I was facing and allowed me to express how work affected my self-confidence. 
                She was completely non-judgmental about my true feelings toward myself and others. She let me ramble on about the
                 same stressors each session and provided guidance on recognizing my emotions.
                </p></blockquote>
                <p id="cardMore" class="expertise-bullets" style="display: none; color: #6e724d; font-size: 15px;">
                    Priscilla introduced me to the DBT method,
                    which helped me understand how my emotions spiral and how to tolerate them. Her approach was extremely 
                    realistic, and I never felt pushed in any direction. She always asked questions to deepen my understanding 
                    of the challenges I was facing.
   
            Priscilla knows how to “read the room” and never ignores slight changes in body language or facial expressions. 
            She feels like a friend who just wants to listen and walk with you. She is very empathetic and accommodating 
            to all my challenges, and she has helped me understand a lot about myself, even the emotions I deemed “shameful.” 
            Overall, I am so grateful for all the sessions I’ve had with Priscilla. I am now more attentive to how my mind and body 
            respond to challenges, and I feel more assured about the role feelings play in my life.

                     Two years ago, I began working with Priscilla to address my depression, anxiety, and 
                deeply ingrained negative thought patterns. At the time, I was trapped in a toxic relationship,
                 feeling lost and misunderstood. From our first session, Priscilla provided something I hadn’t 
                 experienced with any other therapist: true comfort and understanding. As a black cis male, 
                 second-generation Caribbean, queer, and neurodivergent individual, finding a therapist who 
                 could create a safe space for me to open up fully had been a challenge—until I met Priscilla. 
                </p></blockquote>

                    Her approach to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) wasn’t just effective; it was transformative. 
                    She guided me through exercises that helped me reframe my thinking and I began developing healthier 
                    coping mechanisms.
   
                    Priscilla’s approach felt more like having a coach in my corner, always encouraging and guiding me forward. 
                    Her non-judgmental and empathetic nature made me feel genuinely validated, a new and empowering experience 
                    for me. She fostered an environment where I could talk about anything, including painful memories I had 
                    buried for years. During the most challenging times, Priscilla became my beacon of hope. Our sessions blended 
                    laughter, tears, and a safe space where I could express even my deepest anger. Through all these emotions, 
                    Priscilla guided me with such skill and care that my life has taken a complete 360-degree turn for the better.
                    <br><br>
                    Thanks to Priscilla’s dedication and the tools she equipped me with, I’m about to embark on a journey I never 
                    thought possible—I’m starting medical school. This is a step I never imagined I’d be able to take, but because 
                    of Priscilla’s unwavering support and expertise, I’m ready. Priscilla showed me that it’s okay to confront and 
                    acknowledge even the most daunting aspects of our lives, meeting me with the utmost kindness, patience, and grace 
                    along the way. I will forever be grateful for the life-changing impact she’s had on me. If you’re ready to 
                    dedicate yourself to your mental health, I wholeheartedly recommend Priscilla. She will change your life for 
                    the better, just as she did mine. Thank you, Priscilla—I am forever grateful."
